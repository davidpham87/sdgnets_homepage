     {:description-wp "Complementary to mapping actor networks in P1, in P2, we
     work on charting the other side of complexity in urban sustainability
     transformations: the fundamental interconnectedness of SDG implementation
     challenges.  SDGs interact with each other in obvious and non-obvious
     ways (Bennich et al. 2020). SDG interactions can be synergistic or
     conflicting, meaning that goal achievement in one SDG (or target) can both
     positively or negatively affect goal achievement in another SDG (or
     target) (Pham-Truffert et al. 2020).  We use gamification to study mental
     models of SDG interactions held by actors in ZÃ¼rich, in collaboration with
     the ZHdK Gamelab. We explore the ways in which gamification and serious
     games can help actors understand their own mental models about dynamics in
     urban sustainability transformations, as well as the ways in which it can
     help them understand mental models of others. We organize research in this
     sub-project around two guiding questions: RQ2.1: How can gamification and
     serious games contribute to the study of localized SDG interactions?
     RQ2.2: How can gamification and serious games contribute to social
     learning about dynamics in urban sustainability transformations between
     actors?  To answer these questions, we build on and contribute to a lively
     literature on mental models and participatory modeling in sustainability
     research and complex systems in general (Moon et al. 2019). Mental model
     research and participatory modeling is a prime target for gamification and
     serious games (Bakhanova et al. 2020).  For RQ2.1, we gather information
     about perceived interactions among a fixed number of elements of urban
     sustainability transformations (mainly SDG targets, see figure 1b) (Van
     Den Broek 2018). We expose a sample of representatives of organisational
     actors identified in P1 to an interactive, digital representation of
     Zurich. As common in mental model research, actors are then prompted to
     specify their perceptions of how different elements of urban
     sustainability interact. For example, do they think increases in the
     quality of green spaces would lead to visitor pressure in a neighborhood?
     Where do they think reduced car traffic would impact businesses most?
     Where would an increase in tools for citizen participation yield most
     engagement?  At the most basic level, gamification makes it possible for
     actors to get direct feedback about the effect of their model parameter
     choices. More interestingly, gamification opens up unique possibilities to
     expose actors to effects of competing mental models or explorations of
     development scenarios, which we explore with the ZHdK Gamelab. As a data
     gathering approach, this procedure also yields the data to construct a
     crowd-sourced and localized meta-model of SDG interactions in Zurich,
     based on the combined mental models of participating actors.  To answer
     RQ2.2 we explore the transdisciplinary potential of gamification and
     serious games to promote social learning and shared understandings (or
     acceptance for difference) of dynamics in urban sustainability
     transformations. We examine how mental models among actor groups
     differ (for example between powerful and marginal actors). In areas of
     contestation, we collaborate with the ZHdK Gamelab to promote social
     learning and resolve potential conflicts among actors in digital serious
     games (Haug et al. 2011)."
